# Purpose
This is my sandbox for trying out different data tools. The repo is configured to spin up a Postgres database for a ficti0nal sales organisation.

# Setup
`make run` will compose a postgresql DB container. On the first run it will create a database schema and populate with test data. This may take a few minutes.
